TypeScript + React + Sass + Webpack development setup
=======

This setup uses `webpack-dev-server` and `webpack` to compile TypeScript/React into JS and Sass into CSS quickly for a fast development feedback loop.

How to use
-------
`npm start` or `npm serve` starts the webpack-dev-server. You can modify your code inside `src/`, and it will be compiled and hot loaded into the browser.

`npm compile` runs a one-off webpack compilation process, then exits.
